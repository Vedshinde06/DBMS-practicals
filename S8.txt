
Consider following Relation: 
Companies (comp_id, name, cost, year) 
Orders (comp_id, domain, quantity) 
Execute the following query: 
1. Find names, costs, domains and quantities for companies using 
inner join. 
2. Find names, costs, domains and quantities for companies using 
left outer join. 
3. Find names, costs, domains and quantities for companies using 
right outer join. 
4. Find names, costs, domains and quantities for companies using 
Union operator. 
5. Create View View1 by selecting both tables to show company name 
and quantities. 
6. Create View View2 by selecting any two columns and perform 
insert update delete operations. 
7. Display content of View1, View2.
