 
Consider following Relation 
Account (Acc_no, branch_name,balance) 
Branch(branch_name,branch_city,assets) 
Customer(cust_name,cust_street,cust_city) 
Depositor(cust_name,acc_no) 
Loan(loan_no,branch_name,amount) 
Borrower(cust_name,loan_no) 
Create above tables with appropriate constraints like primary key, 
foreign key, not null etc. 
1. Find the branches where average account balance > 15000. 
2. Find number of tuples in customer relation. 
3. Calculate total loan amount given by bank. 
4. Delete all loans with loan amount between 1300 and 1500. 
5. Find the average account balance at each branch 
6. Find name of Customer and city where customer name starts with 
Letter P.
